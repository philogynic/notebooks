    "Hi all, this is my first blog. I write this in order to prepare my next interview in one of online commerce market place in my home country. I think it would be very useful for me to know the domain of the problem. Here I will explore about how data science can be applied in the context of eCommerce. It will be a compilation from many references that I can collect. So I think I will have to write this in parts. I will provide each case with the problem motivation, example data and example code.\n",

    "That's related to how we can improve the algorithm related to the business logic. The other important part for Data Scientist to know is how you want to implement that. Step the technical aside, we still don't know whether our customers see our new things as good or bad. We need to know that before do the implementation. So, you should run the test. For new algorithm, usually the hypothesis just would be; Our new algo will increase customer conversion rate. To be able to design the test is important skills for Data Scientist."
