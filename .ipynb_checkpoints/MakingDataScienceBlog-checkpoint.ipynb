    "There's something called __static site generators__ that allow you to write blog post in a simple formats, usually markdown, then define some settings. The generators then convert your posts into HTML automatically. Using a static site generator, we'd be able to dramatically simplify from .html into just write .md. But then how about managing the content of the blog? I mean, isn't static site generator is just a way to easily making content (instead of writing html file, we write markdown file for example)? How about if I want to make list of topic, list of content, etc? How about the dynamics part of blog site? You can use plugins.\n",

    "Pelican allows you to create a static blog. Most blog sites on the web are dynamic in the sense that the content of the site live in a database. Static websites are easier to deploy than full web applcation built with a web framework that rely on a presistent database backend. In order to view a post on a blog, the server has to query the database, get the right content and then convert it into presentable HTML. However, in a static site, every page is pre-rendered by the static blog generator. This makes static site are typically much faster to load because there are no database queries or middleware code to execute during the HTTP request-response cycle. This means that your entire blog can be uploaded to a server.\n",

So go to my documents or something and make a new directory, named it whatever you want. For me I make a directory called `pelican_learn` inside `Documents`. Then you can `cd` to the directory you already created and type\n",

    "- `develop_server.sh`: shell script for running the development server\n",

    "- `publishconf.py`: another settings file that can be considered as a \"production\" settings file when you move pass the development phase and want to deploy your site.\n",
